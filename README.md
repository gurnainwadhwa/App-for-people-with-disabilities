# Mobile app that makes it easier for people with disabilities to access and use online services.

Our App is an assistive technology app that helps people with low vision or blindness. It uses computer vision and artificial intelligence to identify objects, read text, and provide other information about the surrounding environment. 

Our app has several features that can be helpful for people with low vision or blindness, including:

Object recognition: Lookout can identify objects in the user's field of view, such as people, animals, food, and text.
Text recognition: Lookout can read text from documents, signs, and other sources.
Scene description: Lookout can provide a general description of the user's surroundings, including the location of objects and people.
Barcode scanning: Lookout can scan barcodes to identify products and other objects.
Currency recognition: Lookout can identify different denominations of currency, such as US dollars, euros, and Indian rupees.
Lookout is still under development, but it has already been used by thousands of people around the world. It is a powerful tool that can help people with low vision or blindness live more independent and fulfilling lives.
